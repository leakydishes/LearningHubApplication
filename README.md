## LearningHub: A Pluggable Collaborative Machine Learning Framework for Android Applications
We design and develop `LearningHub',  a new Android application that revolutionizes the learning experience by seamlessly integrating personalized and collaborative machine learning with blockchain. Designed with a user-centric approach, it utilizes Google's ML Firebase and ML Kit, featuring the design of a new Collaborative Learning Framework (CLF) for extracting and converting text from diverse sources. The design philosophy of LearningHub prioritizes advanced coding paradigms and learning capabilities, securely managing user-specific data through Google's ML processing and Room’s SQL Lite local database. Upholding user data sovereignty, LearningHub implements Android's Private Compute Core principles, allowing users control over in-app permissions. Another key highlight of this research work is the successful integration of blockchain technology within LearningHub's architecture, providing an additional layer of security and data integrity crucial for digital learning environments. This study shows further avenues for harnessing the advances in machine learning and blockchain to create a more secure, efficient, and personalized learning experience, with a specific focus on the implementation of the proposed LearningHub architecture.

###### Figure 1. Application Overview, 2023


The Learning Hub application is a study tool which utilises Google’s ML Firebase and ML Kit to enhance the educational experience for students. By incorporating Google’s ML Smart Reply and ML Text Recognition models, users can interact with an AI system, convert text from images and email stored data. Application operates Google’s ML processing and Room’s SQL Lite local database for storing sensitive user information and converted text. Supporting Android’s Private Compute Core (PCC) principles, with users controlling data (inapplication permissions).
